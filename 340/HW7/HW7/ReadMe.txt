README:

This program builds upon a previous project which demonstrated how ADT's and operator overloading work. 
In this newer version, the array is dynamic using pointers to traverse values. The assignment operator
is overloaded in order to copy lists as well. All tests are hard-coded into the program, demonstrating function.
To compile please open command prompt or terminal and run "g++ testList.cpp -o testList" within the same 
directory. Then upon completetion of compilation, double click on the excecutable that was created.
